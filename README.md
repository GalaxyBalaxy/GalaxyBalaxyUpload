# GalaxyBalaxyUpload
My upgraded, tested, and refined python script for uploading music track details

# Installation
Download repo as zip from big green Code button up top. Unzip where you want. Open your terminal, CD to the directory with `setup.py` and run `pip install .`

Alternatively, install the package with `pip install GalaxyBalaxyUpload` from your terminal

# Running
This is configured to work with MusicBee's file sort. Shouldn't be too hard to change the script to your needs. 

Make sure to insert your tokens into the `config.py` file

Simply type `gbu` into your terminal, drag the folder you want to get ready to upload the details for, and you're done. It will send a BBCode table to your clipboard with all the right links and data. I made this for me, so you can change this if this doesn't work for ya.

# Note
This was made with AI with me doing troubleshooting and minor tweaking. I am a simple user, and making something like this was beyond me. If AI bothers you, don't use this script.
